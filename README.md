# Machine Learning Project - Lego Dataset Part Two

- In this project we were tasked with developing a machine learning model in python using `sklearn` libraries and classifiers.
- The goal of this program is to train a machine learning model using images of lego pieces and classify the testing set based on their shape (circle, square, or rectangle)
