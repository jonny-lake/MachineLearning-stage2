# Machine Learning Project - Lego Dataset Part Two

> - In this project we were tasked with developing a machine learning model in python using `sklearn` libraries and classifiers.
> - The goal of this program is to train a machine learning model using images of lego pieces and classify the testing set based on their shape:
    - circle
    - square
    - rectangle

> Run `ENGR418_project_group_41_stage_2.ipynb` to see functionality. We were able to achieve 87.65% accurate classification in stage 2 of the project with images being off centered and needing extra pre-processing to implement the machine learning model.

- The required `python` packages are:
  - `PIL`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `pandas`
  - `skimage`
  - `os`
